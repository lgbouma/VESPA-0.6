vespa
======

``vespa`` is a Python package built to enable automated false positive
probability (FPP) analysis of transiting planet signals (and so much
more!). It implements the latest version of the general procedure
described in detail in `Morton (2012)
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...761....6M>`_, and is being
actively developed on `GitHub
<http://github.com/timothydmorton/vespa>`_.  It also makes use of the
`isochrones <http://isochrones.rtfd.org>`_ package.  Please `raise an
issue <http://github.com/timothydmorton/vespa/issues>`_ with
any questions or comments you may have about this code.
